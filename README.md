# Alua Achievement Tracker
A simple cross platform achievement tracking app, written in C# using the UNO Framework.

# Installing
See Releases tab.

# Building
Clone this repo, and open the .sln in a C# IDE of your choice (I recommend JetBrains Rider)
dotnet build may also work but I don't know.

I have only tested on Arch Linux.

# Roadmap
[See here](https://github.com/users/Rarisma/projects/7/views/2)

# License
I haven't decided yet.
